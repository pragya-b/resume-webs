    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m Pragya S Bodhi, a current BBA (Digital Business & Entrepreneurship) student at IIM Bangalore with a strong passion for creative problem-solving, communication, and entrepreneurship. My journey began early â€” at the age of 10 â€” when I launched my first business selling handcrafted quilling jewelry. Since then, my drive to build meaningful, human-centric ideas has only grown stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bring together business strategy and design thinking, with a keen interest in branding, storytelling, and visual communication. With hands-on experience in marketing, media strategy, and graphic design, I enjoy crafting narratives that connect brands with people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've had the privilege of leading various student-led initiatives and content teams. My achievements include being awarded the <strong>Excellence in Communication</strong> title among 200+ peers, winning <strong>Best Marketing Manager</strong> at Christ University, receiving a <strong>Special Mention in NOVA 2024</strong>, and earning a <strong>Certificate of Recommendation</strong> from the Chairman of Transcend Group of Institutions for my contributions to the Student Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, Iâ€™m exploring opportunities at the intersection of design, media, and business innovation. Whether itâ€™s building startups like <strong>Bofoo</strong>, crafting brand campaigns, or collaborating with cross-functional teams â€” I thrive in spaces where creativity and impact meet.
    </p>
